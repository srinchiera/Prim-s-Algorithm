When generating keep an extra column to store smallest edge in the row.
Can we get the distribution of the smallest numbers in a uniform range?
What's the probability of our algorithm using an edge greater than k? If the p is less than .0001 can we throw it away?

malloc graph space in main, pass pointer, and then call generate passing pointer to matrix

Take out memory accesses.

Take out edges using order statistics. What's the probability that


1D case removing edges
say n = 10
pdf of the smallest number out of 10 uniformly chosen numbers
pdf of smallest number out of 9 uniformly chosen numbers
...
pdf of smallest number out of 1 uniformly chosen number

Sum these all up

We might have to make an adjacency list :(

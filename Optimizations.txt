Cut array into two.
When generating keep an extra column to store smallest edge in the row.
Can we get the distribution of the smallest numbers in a uniform range?
What's the probability of our algorithm using an edge greater than k? If the p is less than .0001 can we throw it away?

malloc graph space in main, pass pointer, and then call generate passing pointer to matrix
